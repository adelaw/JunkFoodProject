  <h2>The Real Junk Food Project Sheffield</h2>
  <p>The sign by the café on Club Garden Road promises you’ll soon be experiencing the ‘Real Junk Food Project’, but as I’m checking out the menu, nothing about berlotti bean stew or salmon fishcakes strikes me as ‘junk food’. </p>
  <p>If you didn’t know, I wonder if you’d notice. What I consider to be junk food - unhealthy, fattening and leaving me full of regret afterwards - is certainly not what this team of volunteers are serving up today. </p>
<p>Unlike any other cafe I have been to, all the ingredients put into these dishes are past their best before dates, and were destined for the bin.</p>

<h2>The history of junk</h2>
<p>The Real Junk Food Project is an initiative that has been rolled out across the country, and more - they even have branches in France, Germany and Australia.</p>
<p>It was set up in December 2013 by Sam Joseph, Conor Walsh and Adam Smith to address the issue of food wastage. The first café was set up in Armley, Leeds.  Adam, a trained chef living in Australia, followed the motto ‘if you want to change the world, start at home’. </p>
<h3>Where's my nearest cafe?</h3></section>

<section class="content"><p>The Sheffield branch of the Junk Food Project opened its doors towards the end of 2015 and is ran by Jo Hercsberg and her partner Rene Meijer. The pair ran pop-up events initially, using social media to promote the events.</p>
<p>They opened up their café in mid-November, but didn’t want to publicise it much; apparently, they have never run a café before. </p>

<section class="start content"><p>Speaking about the first of the pop-up events, Rene said: “We just didn’t really know how it was all going to work out. Then on the day we had loads of food and we weren’t quite sure there was going to be enough people to eat all of it, then 120 people turned up.</p>
<p>“It was just amazing. I think food waste is such a topical issue for people.”</p>
<p>And this seems to be true - food waste is increasingly entering the public consciousness. A Google search for pages that use the term ‘food waste’ before 2010 brings up just over 19,000,000 pages. But the same Google search, from 2011 to the present finds over 72,400,000 results. </p>

<h2>So why are people starting to care about food waste?</h2>
<p>Love Food Hate Waste (LFHW) estimates that we throw away 7 million tonnes of food and drink from our homes every year, although some cite this as closer to 15 million tonnes.</p>
<p>In 2015, as part of the UN, the UK agreed to 17 sustainable development goals, one of which included the commitment to halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels.  The cross-party Food Waste (Reduction) Bill currently trying to be put forward in Parliament outlines a strategy to help accomplish this goal. </p>
<p>But the second reading of the bill, championed by the Shadow Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs Secretary Kerry McCarthy, has now been rescheduled twice. It is has been rescheduled again for April 22. Although a public concern, the issue is yet to be politicized and perhaps is not yet a priority for the UK government.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/adelaham">@adelaham</a> Hi, the House adjourned before this Bill was debated and it has been provisionally rescheduled for Friday 22 April.</p>&mdash; House of Commons (@HouseofCommons) <a href="https://twitter.com/HouseofCommons/status/709756577083863040">March 15, 2016</a></blockquote>

<h2>The main culprits</h2>
<p>The proposed Bill would require large supermarkets, manufacturers and distributors to reduce their food waste across their supply chains by no less than 30 per cent of their 2016 levels by 2025.</p>
<p>Up until recently, Rene says, the large chain supermarkets didn’t engage with the project.  He said: “They made all the right noises when they were interviewed on TV but no-one really did anything.”</p>
<p>This does seem to be changing now. Tescos has recently committed to reducing it’s food waste to zero by 2017. Tesco’s ‘Community Food Connection’ will be rolled out across the country. This will distribute Tescos surplus food through FareShare, a distribution platform.</p> 
<p>FareShare, set up in 2004, is a charity trying to reduce food waste through a distribution network.</p>
<p>Yet Rene says this isn’t really solving their waste issues. This is because there is a membership fee charities have to pay first before they can access the food.  “Basically, they’re still selling it off”, he says.</p>
<p>FareShare said: “We charge our charity members membership fees which are nominal charges to cover some of our running costs such as fuel and transportation. </p>

<section class="start content"> <p>“Membership fees are a way for FareShare to generate some income to cover some of its basic running costs as a charity so that it is sustainable now and in the future.”</p>
<p>The Junk Food Project has found their own way round this fee. They receive food from Waitrose and Marks and Spencers on Ecclesall Road as well as a number of local Sheffield businesses for free by collecting it themselves.</p> 
<p>Rene says he thinks it makes a difference being able to actually speak to the owners and managers of the stores, as it means they are able to bypass a lot of the procedures involved with receiving food waste from the larger supermarkets.</p>
<h3>Bread and breakfast club</h3>
<p>The project is also to start working with Fuel for Schools, a project that provides breakfast for children in deprived areas. Last year, an annual report by the Department for Work and Pensions showed that 2.3 million children in the UK are classed as living in relative poverty. The number of people using foodbanks is also increasing.</p>

<p>Rene said: “[Fuel for Schools] can ensure that before those children are put in a classroom they are actually fed and ready to learn and not feeling like they don’t want to be where they are because they’re just hungry. </p>
<p>“Hopefully we can kill two birds with one stone with a project like that: we can actually find a good destination for the bread and we can feed children.”</p>
<h2>The future of junk</h2>
<p>On a Sunday lunchtime, I noticed the café was as busy as any other café that served up ‘normal’ food.  From what I could see, food waste isn’t just a trendy issue that attracts students and activists in Sheffield. Children from the nearby estate came in for both breakfast and lunch, filling a glass jar on the table with 50p coins and a woman came in with her grown-up son, both choosing the vegan option for their Sunday dinner. Statistics aside, there is clearly a demand for this food.</p>
<p>My Local has supported the project for a couple of months now. Rene say they are have been one of the most pro-active larger chains but just recently, they’ve started to see a reduction in how much they’ve been receiving from the stores. The chain had started to change their ordering system. </p>

<section class="content"><p>I wondered if there was a contradiction in this, whether it was a success or a loss to the project. After all, their business model is based on the overexcessive nature of the UK’s food supply chains. Without the food waste, there would be no Junk Food Project. But Rene said: “Ultimately the goal for us should be to go out of business because this shouldn't be necessary. </p>
<p>“We are not trying to make a living out of food waste, we are trying to make a point. The point ultimately should be that we change how this works.”</p>
<p>Unlike any other cafe I have been to, all the ingredients put into my dinner last Sunday were past their best before dates, and were destined for the bin but hopefully, as Rene tells me, this might not be the case for much longer.</p>
